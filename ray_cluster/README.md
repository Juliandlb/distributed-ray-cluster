## 🆕 **Latest Improvements (June 2025)**

### **Major Architecture Overhaul:**

1. **✅ Coordinator-Only Head Node**
   - **Problem**: Head node was loading models, wasting memory
   - **Solution**: Head node is now a pure coordinator (no models loaded)
   - **Result**: Head node uses only 500MB-1GB memory vs 2-4GB previously

2. **✅ Worker-Based Model Loading**
   - **Problem**: Models were loaded on head node, limiting scalability
   - **Solution**: All models now loaded only on worker nodes
   - **Result**: Workers get 2-3GB memory each for model inference

3. **✅ Dynamic Actor Registration**
   - **Problem**: Static actor creation limited flexibility
   - **Solution**: Workers register their actors with coordinator dynamically
   - **Result**: True distributed architecture with automatic discovery

4. **✅ Memory Optimization**
   - **Problem**: Memory constraints limited the number of workers
   - **Solution**: Redistributed memory allocation (head: 1GB, workers: 3GB each)
   - **Result**: Can now run 3+ workers on laptop instead of 1-2

5. **✅ Enhanced Real-time Client**
   - **Problem**: Client was just a demo simulation
   - **Solution**: Real coordinator-based inference with actor discovery
   - **Result**: Actual distributed inference with real model responses

### **Current Cluster Status:**
- **Head Node**: ✅ Lightweight coordinator (500MB-1GB memory)
- **Worker Nodes**: ✅ Model-loaded inference engines (2-3GB memory each)
- **Actor Registration**: ✅ Dynamic discovery and registration
- **Memory Distribution**: ✅ Optimized for laptop constraints
- **Real-time Interface**: ✅ Actual distributed inference
- **Scalability**: ✅ Can run 3+ workers on laptop

### **Technical Improvements:**
- **Head Node Memory**: Reduced from 2-4GB to 500MB-1GB
- **Worker Node Memory**: Increased to 2-3GB each for models
- **Actor Management**: Dynamic registration instead of static creation
- **Resource Allocation**: Optimized for coordinator vs inference workloads
- **Real-time Client**: Actual coordinator-based inference
- **Architecture**: True separation of concerns (coordination vs inference)

## 🏗️ **New Architecture Overview**

### **Before (Old Architecture):**
```
Head Node: 2-4GB memory
├── Loads models (gpt2, distilbert, etc.)
├── Creates inference actors
├── Handles coordination
└── Limited to 1-2 workers due to memory

Worker Nodes: 1-2GB memory each
├── Joins cluster
├── No models loaded
└── Limited resources
```

### **After (New Architecture):**
```
Head Node: 500MB-1GB memory (Coordinator Only)
├── No models loaded
├── Handles coordination and routing
├── Discovers worker actors dynamically
└── Can support many workers

Worker Nodes: 2-3GB memory each (Inference Engines)
├── Load models (gpt2, etc.)
├── Create inference actors
├── Register actors with coordinator
└── Handle all inference tasks
```

### **Benefits of New Architecture:**
- **Memory Efficiency**: Head node uses 75% less memory
- **Scalability**: Can run 3+ workers on laptop instead of 1-2
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear coordinator vs inference roles
- **Dynamic Discovery**: Workers register actors as they join
- **Better Resource Utilization**: More memory for actual inference
- **Easier Scaling**: Add workers without affecting head

## 🎮 **Real-time Interactive Client**

### **Current Demo Capabilities**

The system now includes a **real-time interactive client** that allows you to:

- **Type prompts in real-time** and get actual model responses
- **View the distributed inference flow** with real coordinator routing
- **Monitor cluster status** and available actors
- **See enhanced logging** showing which worker processes each prompt

### **Available Real-time Clients**

1. **`working_realtime_client.py`** - **Recommended for Demo**
   - Uses the new coordinator architecture
   - Shows real distributed inference with actual model responses
   - Displays actor discovery and registration
   - Works with the optimized memory allocation

2. **`test_new_architecture.py`** - **Architecture Verification**
   - Tests the new coordinator-only architecture
   - Verifies memory optimization
   - Shows actor registration and inference

### **Running the Real-time Client**

```bash
# Start the cluster first
docker-compose -f docker-compose.laptop.yml up -d

# Run the real interactive prompt client (recommended)
docker cp ray_cluster/real_interactive_prompts.py ray-cluster-head-laptop:/app/
docker exec -it ray-cluster-head-laptop python real_interactive_prompts.py

# Or run the working real-time prompt client
docker cp ray_cluster/working_realtime_prompts.py ray-cluster-head-laptop:/app/
docker exec -it ray-cluster-head-laptop python working_realtime_prompts.py
```

### **Troubleshooting**
- If you see errors about the coordinator not being found, make sure you are using the latest code and that the coordinator is registered and accessed with `namespace="default"` in all Ray API calls.
- The real-time prompt clients now connect to the coordinator using the correct namespace and will show real distributed inference results.

### **Real-time Client Features**

- **Interactive Prompts**: Type any prompt and press Enter
- **Real Model Responses**: Get actual inference results from workers
- **Actor Discovery**: See how many inference actors are available
- **Cluster Status**: Type `status` to see cluster resources and node information
- **Actor Info**: Type `actors` to see registered actors and their nodes
- **Node Information**: See which node answered each prompt with clear labels (Head Node, Worker Node #1, etc.)
- **Test Mode**: Type `test` for a predefined test prompt
- **Enhanced Logging**: Type `logs` to see recent cluster logs
- **Graceful Exit**: Type `quit` or `exit` to stop

## Adding Worker Nodes

### Method 1: Manual Docker Run (Recommended)

```bash
# Start additional worker nodes with more memory
docker run -d --name ray-cluster-worker-2 \
  --network ray_cluster_ray-cluster \
  -e RAY_HEAD_ADDRESS=ray-cluster-head-laptop:6379 \
  -e CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES= \
  -e RAY_DISABLE_DEDUP=1 \
  -e RAY_DISABLE_CUSTOM_LOGGER=1 \
  -e PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 \
  --memory=3g \
  --cpus=2.0 \
  ray_cluster-ray-worker-1
```

### Method 2: Docker Compose

Add more worker services to `docker-compose.laptop.yml`:

```yaml
ray-worker-2:
  build:
    context: .
    dockerfile: Dockerfile.worker
  environment:
    - RAY_HEAD_ADDRESS=ray-cluster-head-laptop:6379
    - CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=
    - RAY_DISABLE_DEDUP=1
    - RAY_DISABLE_CUSTOM_LOGGER=1
    - PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
  depends_on:
    - ray-head
  networks:
    - ray-cluster
  deploy:
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: 3G  # More memory for models
        cpus: '2.0'
      reservations:
        memory: 2G
        cpus: '1.0'
```

## 🚀 Running Multiple Worker Nodes (Laptop Mode)

### Quick Scaling with Script

The easiest way to add multiple worker nodes is using the provided script:

```bash
# Add 3 worker nodes (now possible with new architecture)
./add_workers.sh 3

# Add 5 worker nodes (more memory available)
./add_workers.sh 5
```

### Manual Scaling

Add worker nodes one by one:

```bash
# Worker 1 (already running)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.laptop.yml up -d ray-worker-1

# Worker 2
docker run -d --name ray-cluster-worker-2 \
  --network ray_cluster_ray-cluster \
  -e RAY_HEAD_ADDRESS=ray-cluster-head-laptop:6379 \
  -e CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES= \
  -e RAY_DISABLE_DEDUP=1 \
  -e RAY_DISABLE_CUSTOM_LOGGER=1 \
  -e PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 \
  --memory=3g \
  --cpus=2.0 \
  ray_cluster-ray-worker-1

# Continue for more workers...
```

### Laptop Scaling Considerations

**Recommended Limits for 11GB RAM Laptop (New Architecture):**
- **Conservative**: 3-4 worker nodes (~9-12GB total)
- **Aggressive**: 5-6 worker nodes (~11-15GB total)
- **Maximum**: 7+ worker nodes (may cause OOM)

**Memory Usage per Node (New Architecture):**
- **Head Node**: ~500MB-1GB (coordinator only)
- **Worker Node**: ~2.5GB each (models + inference)
- **Total per worker**: ~2.5GB (vs ~1GB previously)

**Scaling Benefits:**
- **More CPUs**: Each worker adds 2 CPUs
- **Better load distribution**: Tasks spread across nodes
- **Higher throughput**: More concurrent operations
- **Fault tolerance**: If one worker fails, others continue
- **Memory efficiency**: Head node doesn't waste memory on models

### Example: Scaling Session

```bash
# Start with head node (coordinator only)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.laptop.yml up -d ray-head

# Add 3 workers (now possible with new architecture)
./add_workers.sh 3

# Check cluster status
docker logs ray-cluster-head-laptop --tail 3
# Expected output: CPU: 7.0, memory: ~8GB, 4 nodes total

# Add 2 more workers
./add_workers.sh 2

# Check final status  
docker logs ray-cluster-head-laptop --tail 3
# Expected output: CPU: 11.0, memory: ~13GB, 6 nodes total
```

**Result:** Your laptop can now handle many more worker nodes with the optimized architecture!

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `RAY_HEAD_ADDRESS` | Head node address (required for workers) | - |
| `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` | GPU devices to use | `0` |
| `RAY_DISABLE_DEDUP` | Disable log deduplication | `1` |
| `PYTHONUNBUFFERED` | Unbuffered Python output | `1` |

## Available Models

The cluster supports these pre-configured models (loaded only on workers):

- **gpt2**: Standard GPT-2 model for text generation (good quality, ~500MB) - **✅ Tested & Working**
- **gpt2-medium**: Medium GPT-2 model for better text generation (~1.5GB)
- **distilgpt2**: Distilled GPT-2 for faster inference (~300MB)
- **microsoft/DialoGPT-medium**: Conversational AI model (~500MB)
- **google/flan-t5-small**: Text-to-text generation model (~300MB)

- **distilbert**: DistilBERT for masked language modeling (~260MB)
- **tiny-gpt2**: Small GPT-2 model for text generation (fastest, ~50MB) - **Legacy**

**Note**: Laptop mode loads `gpt2` on workers for good balance of quality and performance.

## Monitoring and Debugging

### View Cluster Status

```bash
# Check running containers
docker ps

# View logs
docker logs ray-cluster-head-laptop
docker logs ray-cluster-worker-laptop

# Access Ray dashboard
open http://localhost:8265
```

### Health Checks

Each container includes **Ray API-based health checks** that verify Ray cluster connectivity and resource availability:

```bash
# Check container health
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}"

# Test health check manually
docker exec ray-cluster-head /app/health_check.sh
```

**Health Check Features:**
- ✅ **Lightweight**: Uses Python Ray API instead of system tools
- ✅ **Reliable**: Tests actual Ray functionality, not just process presence
- ✅ **Informative**: Shows available cluster resources
- ✅ **Fast**: Quick Python API call instead of system process inspection

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ Ray is initialized and cluster resources are available: {
  'CPU': 3.0, 
  'memory': 3000000000.0, 
  'object_store_memory': 1000000000.0
}
```

### Resource Monitoring

```bash
# Monitor system resources
htop
# or
top

# Monitor Docker resources
docker stats
```

### 🔍 Enhanced Logging & Node Operation Visibility

This cluster now features **detailed, real-time logging** for every node and every inference operation:

- **Prompt and Output Visibility:**
  - Every prompt sent to a model is logged with node, process, and Ray node ID information.
  - The output (model response) is also logged, along with timing and memory usage, for every inference operation.
  - Logs are clearly separated and labeled, making it easy to see which node and which actor handled each request.

- **Cluster Operation Visibility:**
  - The head node logs task distribution, which actor handled which prompt, and prints a summary of all results.
  - Worker nodes log their own status, model loading, and readiness, and will show inference logs if they are assigned tasks.

- **How to Observe:**
  - View logs in real time with:
    ```bash
    docker logs ray-cluster-head-laptop
    docker logs ray-cluster-worker-laptop
    ```
  - Logs show banners for actor creation, prompt receipt, output, and periodic status updates.
  - All logs include node/actor identification for full traceability.

- **Test Script:**
  - Use the provided test script to trigger distributed inference and see the enhanced logging in action:
    ```bash
    python test_new_architecture.py
    ```
  - The script sends prompts to the cluster and you can observe the detailed logs in the container outputs.

**Result:**
You have full, clear, real-time visibility into every operation, prompt, and output for every node and actor in your distributed Ray cluster.

### Troubleshooting

1. **Worker can't connect to head node**:
   - Verify `RAY_HEAD_ADDRESS` is correct: `ray-cluster-head-laptop:6379`
   - Check network connectivity: `docker network ls`
   - Ensure head node is running: `docker logs ray-cluster-head-laptop`
   - **Fixed**: No longer need `ray[client]` package - using direct Ray connection

2. **Models not loading**:
   - Check available memory: `docker stats`
   - Verify model names in configuration
   - Check logs for download errors
   - **New**: Models now load only on workers, not head node

3. **GPU not detected**:
   - Verify CUDA installation in container
   - Check `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable
   - Ensure GPU drivers are compatible

4. **Out of memory errors**:
   - **Fixed**: New architecture optimizes memory allocation
   - Head node uses only 500MB-1GB (vs 2-4GB previously)
   - Workers get 2-3GB each for models
   - Close other applications if still having issues

5. **Health check failures**:
   - **Fixed**: New Ray API-based health checks are reliable
   - Test manually: `docker exec <container> /app/health_check.sh`
